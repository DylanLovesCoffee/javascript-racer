# Javascript Racer
This is a one page application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to simulate a racing game meant for one or two players.

Every key press is meant to simulate the roll of a six-sided die. Ideally, every roll gives you a random number until you make it to the finish line.

Simply mash your 'Q' and 'P' keys to race!
